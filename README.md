# Multichannel Pitch-to-MIDI Converter

![Hz Pitch to MIDI](https://github.com/cycfi/hz_audio_to_midi/blob/master/docs/images/MIDI_Guitar-16-9.png?raw=true)

This project aims to create an open-source multichannel pitch-to-MIDI converter with 8 audio inputs, one MIDI output, and one USB output, leveraging the Hz Pitch Detection system hosted by the Q DSP library's Hz Pitch Detection System for precise and efficient pitch tracking The device will convert audio signals from multiple sources into MIDI (MPE and MIDI-2) in real time with minimal latency, providing a high-quality and customizable solution for electric guitars, basses, and other instruments.

This is a nascent project, and the initial feasibility assessment will be gauged on engagement, so your involvement is crucial in these early stages. Give the project a star, and [join in and introduce yourself](https://github.com/cycfi/hz_audio_to_midi/discussions/2). Share your background, your interest in pitch-to-MIDI conversion, and whether you see yourself as a potential user of this product. This will help us gauge community interest and understand how many people might benefit from this project. I'll set a modest target of 200 interested people and let's grow it from there.

**And by all means, spread the word!**

As Andreas Szalay, creator of the Fishman Triple Play, noted, it took him six years to release the product, and many years later after release, software issues persist. I can lay the groundwork for a multichannel audio-to-MIDI solution, but fine-tuning for various applications, instruments, and sensors will need broader community involvement. Together, we can bring this project to life and adapt it for various applications and instruments.

## Features
- 8 audio inputs for multiple sources (e.g., divided pickups, piezo pickups, Roland GK3)
- Real-time audio to MIDI (MPE and MIDI-2) conversion
- Minimal latency for accurate performance
- MIDI and USB outputs

## Community Collaboration
This project is open-source and relies on community interest and collaboration to succeed. If you're interested in contributing, discussing ideas, or joining the development, please be part of the [discussions](https://github.com/cycfi/hz_audio_to_midi/discussions). Even the very act of joining and keeping company will fuel enthusiasm not only for the developers but also for the community as a whole. Your presence and support, whether through active contribution or simply engaging in discussions, can have a huge impact. It helps build momentum, keeps everyone motivated, and fosters a sense of belonging and shared purpose.
