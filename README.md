# Multichannel Pitch-to-MIDI Converter

This project aims to create an open-source multichannel pitch-to-MIDI converter with 8 audio inputs, one MIDI output, and one USB output. The device will convert audio signals from multiple sources into MIDI (MPE and MIDI-2) in real time with minimal latency, providing a high-quality and customizable solution for electric guitars, basses, and other instruments.

## Features
- Leverages the Hz Pitch Detection system hosted by the Q DSP library's Hz Pitch Detection System for precise and efficient pitch tracking
- 8 audio inputs for multiple sources (e.g., divided pickups, piezo pickups, Roland GK3)
- Real-time audio to MIDI (MPE and MIDI-2) conversion
- Minimal latency for accurate performance
- MIDI and USB outputs
